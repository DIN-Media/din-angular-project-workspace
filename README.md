## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Manual testing using on-board users

Once you have run the application and followed the steps above, you will need to log in as follows:

1. click on the `Dummy-Konto` hypertext link in the inline footer of the login card,
2. select an account by clicking on the name of the account you wish to use,
3. confirm your choice by clicking on the `Best√§tigen` button.
4. The credentials of the chosen account will be automatically filled in the fields `Email` and `Passwort`.
5. All you have to do now is click on the `Jetzt anmelden` button to log in.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
